Greetings, I am Jeremy Kitchen, I'm a ham radio operator, and my call sign is K1CHN.

I have a fairly extensive profile and "ham radio CV" over on my [QRZ profile](https://qrz.com/db/K1CHN), but I hope to pull that information over to here at some point.

I also hope to use this site as a place to write about working as a ham, ham activities, resources, etc.

Or maybe it'll just be a place I post photos from Cycle Oregon. Who knows?

Either way, welcome, and thanks for reading!
