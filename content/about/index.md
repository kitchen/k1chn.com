Greetings, I am Jeremy Kitchen, I'm a ham radio operator, and my call sign is K1CHN.

I have a fairly extensive profile and "ham radio CV" over on my [QRZ profile](https://qrz.com/db/K1CHN), but I hope to pull that information over to here at some point.

I also hope to use this site as a place to write about working as a ham, ham activities, resources, etc.

Or maybe it'll just be a place I post photos from Cycle Oregon. Who knows?

Either way, welcome, and thanks for reading!

If you'd like to contact me, my email address is [k1chn@k1chn.com](mailto:k1chn@k1chn.com), or you can call or text to 503-432-9536. Alternatively, I'm sometimes listening on the [147.040 K7RPT repeater](https://www.arrg.org/repeater-list/) in Portland.

I have a radio that can do d-star, but I haven't a clue how to actually use it for much of anything. If you want to reach me on d-star and want to help me understand it, I would love to hear from you :)

If you're feeling up for it, I have a non-ham-radio personal blog over at [words.kitchen.io](https://words.kitchen.io/).
