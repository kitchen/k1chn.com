This is my ham radio blog.

It's running [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and using a modified version of the [purehugo](https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo) theme. I like this theme and it's very simple. I've made some customizations and upgraded the version of [purecss](https://purecss.io/) it's running on.

Enjoy.

# hugo version

I have tested this (at least at a very basic "does the front page load?" level) all the way to hugo v0.72.0. There was a breaking change at 0.67.0 that I had to fix, and a deprecation notice that I also fixed right around that same release cycle, but otherwise it should be set!
