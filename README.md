This is my ham radio blog.

It's running [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and using a modified version of the [purehugo](https://github.com/dplesca/purehugo) theme. I like this theme and it's very simple. I've made some customizations and upgraded the version of [purecss](https://purecss.io/) it's running on.

Enjoy.
